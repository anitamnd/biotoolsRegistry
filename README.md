# What is biotoolsregistry?
**biotoolsregistry** (bio.tools) is the Web application of the [ELIXIR Tools & Data Services Registry](https://bio.tools).  It allows the curation and discovery of bioinformatics resources including databases, tools, services and so on, available under a variety of interfaces. 

bio.tools provides a query interface, registration interface and API. The **query interface** allows a user to search the corpus of resource descriptions, display what fields of information are shown and filter and sort the results by various attributes.  The **registration interface** allows the manual creation and editing of resource descriptions.  The HTTP-based **API** allows query as well as automated creation and update of accessions.

bio.tools depends upon a resource description model: [biotoolsSchema](https://github.com/bio-tools/biotoolsSchema).

# Motivation
In support of discoveries in the life sciences, a plethora of databases and tools are deployed, in technically complex and diverse implementations, across a spectrum of scientific disciplines. The corpus of documentation of these resources is fragmented across the Web, with much redundancy, and has lacked a common standard of information. The outcome is that scientists must often struggle to find, understand, compare and use the best resources for the task at hand.  The need - which biotoolsregistry supports - is for a comprehensive and consistent registry of information about bioinformatics resources.

# Documentation and website

bio.tools, supported by [ELIXIR](https://www.elixir-europe.org/) â€” the European infrastructure for biological information - is available at
